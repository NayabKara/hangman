Getting started: 

<br>
link to game: 

<br>
instructions: once the page has loaded, the game will set up a secret word for the player to guess. type in you submissios in the input box, and the click submit. if the guess is correct, the letter will be printed in the puzzle blanks. if not, a part of the hangman figure will appear.The player has a maximum of 6 chances to get the puzzle right, after which the game will be over. To reset, just refresh the page.

Next Steps: 
<br>
 Outside of additional styling, in the future I would like to add more themes, as well as more elements in the arrays to make the game harder. Additionally, I want to make the letters in the Letter Bank clickable, and track which ones have been used by striking them through. that would replace the input area which I find to be a bit clunky.
